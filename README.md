# One-Legged-Robot3
This is the source code for a one legged robot (2 servos) on an Arduino Mega 2560 R3. This is the continuous version. 

I became interested in making a version of this robot that could put its toe at any point in a 2-dimensional space.  This robot can do that.  The default code draws a circle in the sky before walking forward and then walking backward.
